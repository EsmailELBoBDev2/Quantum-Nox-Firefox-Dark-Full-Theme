<h3>Previously known as "Firefox 57+ full dark theme with scrollbars and multirow tabs", I decided to give it an actual name instead of leaving it as just a description.</h3>
<p>This theme is mainly intended for the stable release of Firefox (<b>This means that while it will most probably work with nightly and ESR for the most part, it may have less support for those versions</b>).</p>
<p>You can use it to fully change the colors of most of firefox UI to dark-gray colors (with #222-#444 colors mostly), including scrollbars, tooltips, sidebar, as well as some other things, such as removing some context menu options, enabling multirow tabs, changing the font of the url bar...</p>
<p><b>Of course... you could as well use these files to color your firefox any way you wanted</b>, the only thing you'd have to do is change the correct values (what each class or id does is commented above each) in the .css files (as far as you know some 
basic css or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">color coding</a>, it shouldn't be too hard) using notepad, or some code editing program (such as notepad++ on Windows).</p>
<p>To change these you will have to use the right hex codes. You can find a color picker to hex code in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">this page</a>.</p>
<h4>If you want to edit a file and you want to use notepad (windows), you may see that all code is a wall of text without any line break (the files get compressed like that when uploaded, so there isn't much to do there), in which case you can always drag & drop the file you want to modify into any internet browser window (like firefox) to see the actual code with line breaks, and then copy & paste it back to the open file with notepad, making it regain the line breaks on notepad again.<br />
<br />
This problem doesn't happen if you use a code editor such as notepad++, atom, sublime text...</h4>

<h3>A note on people looking to replace some Tab Mix Plus features</h3>
<p>As for using this theme to replace some functions of <b>Tab Mix Plus</b>, I'll keep the functions that can be done through CSS here until TMP gets back on track on webextensions (since these fixes are a bit more annoying to toggle for people that don't know CSS), but as of right now, it covers multi-row tabs, keep the close button on tabs always visible, and color-coding tabs when they are loaded, unloaded, etc...</p>
<p>Most other functions of Tab Mix Plus can already be "simulated" changing some <code>about:config</code> settings:</p>
 <ul>
 	<li>To keep FF open even after closing the last tab -> <code>browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab</code> to <i>false</i>.</li>
 	<li>To open a search result typed on the URL bar on a new tab -> <code>browser.urlbar.openintab</code> to <i>true</i>.</li>
 	<li>To open a search result typed on the search bar on a new tab -> <code>browser.search.openintab</code> to <i>true</i>.</li>
 	<li>To open bookmarks on a new tab instead of the current tab -> <code>browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInTabs</code> to <i>true</i>.</li>
 	<li>To force popups on new tabs instead of windows -> <code>browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction</code> to <i>0</i> (should be 2 by default).</li>
 	<li>Open related tabs (the ones you open) as the last tab in the tab bar -> <code>browser.tabs.insertRelatedAfterCurrent</code> to <i>false</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>... or through extensions (not a comprehensive list, only the ones themed here are mentioned), like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/">Tab session manager</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/undo-closed-tabs-revived/">Undo closed tabs button</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Main browser UI</h3>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zNKhEV6.png" title="Dark firefox UI with custom background" />

<p>If you are on windows and only want the theme or multirow, you can use the batch file installers inside the "installers" folder.</p> 

<p>If you are using Linux or Mac, or want to add some more functionability (like deleting some useless context menu commands), you will have to use the methods described inside the 3 main folders of this repository:</p>

<h4>Short version</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>CSS tweaks</b>: Enables removal of context menu items, multirow bookmarks, changing tab bar position (so that it could be under the bookmarks bar for example)</li>
  <li><b>Full dark theme</b>: Gives dark colors to firefox UI, including the scrollbars and the tooltips.</li>
  <li><b>Multirow and other functions</b>: You can find the JS files that add extra functionability to Firefox that couldn't be done with CSS alone.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Detailed explanation</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>CSS tweaks</b>: In this one you will find a userchrome with ONLY the features part of the theme (with the exception of multiple row tabs, which can be only enabled using the <b><code>MultiRowTabLiteforFx.uc.js</code> file inside the "Tooltips, Scrollbars & Multirow tabs\chrome" folder</b>). These features are the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>Multiple row tabs (only through <code>MultiRowTabLiteforFx.uc.js</code>). <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3LbvuMU.png"></li>
	  <li>Multiple row bookmarks toolbar (2 usable rows by default, but it is NOT enabled by default. You can add more rows editing userchrome).</li>
	  <li>Hides some rarely used commands on the context menu such as "Set image as desktop background" (you can turn these on again).</li>
	  <li>Changes the tab close button to always be visible.</li>
	  <li>You can hide the sidebar completelly resizing it instead of having to click the sidebar button.</li>
	  <li>Can change the URL bar font (You have to change the commented line on userchrome to use it).</li>
	  <li>Can change the tabs position under the URL bar (You have to change the commented line on userchrome to use it).</li>
	</ul></li>
  <li><b>Full dark theme</b>: Following the method described in this folder you will ONLY color Firefox (unless you use the dark theme + CSS tweaks userchrome file there), including a different style to scrollbars, and tooltips.<br />
  If you only want to use a dark theme, and keep all the context menu options when right clicking on tabs/the web area (such as "Send image..." or "Send tab to device"), use the default userchrome in this folder instead of the "Dark theme + CSS tweaks userchrome" one. Apart from the basic Firefox UI theming, you can also theme a few other optional things (they require some editing of userchrome.css, or copying addons.css into the chrome folder):
	<ul>
	  <li>Styling for unloaded and unread tab titles.</li>
	  <li>Can change the tab line color to Windows current theme color (You have to change the commented line that is described in line 19 inside <code>userChrome.css</code>).</li>
	  <li>Can change the background image of your lightweight theme to one of your choice on <code>userChrome.css</code> (You have to be using a lightweight theme instead of the default dark theme of Firefox).</li>
	  <li>Can change the default text color of input boxes for those using a dark OS theme that affects the background of these (You have to change the commented line that is described on line 15 inside <code>usercontent.css</code> to use it)</li>
	  <li>Change the theme of any of the addons listed in the addons section below (You have to update the UUIDs of the extensions inside "addons.css" for this).</li>
	  <li>Can set an image as background for the home page (You have to change the commented line that is described in line 19 inside <code>userContent.css</code>).<br /></li>
	</ul><br /></li>
</ul>

<h4>You can turn the features you want on or off changing the commented lines on <code>userchrome.css</code> (To change them you just have to open it with notepad or any code editor, and encase between "/*" and "*/" (without the quotation marks) the lines you don't want to take effect). Of course, if you think that you are NEVER going to use certain feature, you can always delete the specific lines you don't want without any other side-effect.</h4>

<p>You can find a video tutorial on how to install the theme without installers <a href="https://youtu.be/kNHe6XDgUN4">here</a>.</p>

<h2>General sites dark theme</h2>
<p>You can add the global dark userstyle found inside the <b>Global dark userstyle</b> folder to theme general sites with an all-around CSS stylesheet.</p>
<p>While it's not perfect (meaning that you should still use per-site styles for the sites you visit often), it can help to darken most sites when browsing around general sites that you don't visit often, and thus don't want/can't find a specific userstyle for them.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/S34ylDn.png">

<h2>Addon dark themes</h2>
<p>You can apply a dark theme to certain addons changing the UUID's of them inside the <code>addons.css</code> file inside the "Full dark theme" folder (more instructions on how to do that inside the addons file).</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m7TGyqz.png" title="Dark addons" />

<h3>The scrollbars</h3>

<p>This theme colors scrollbars using <code>usercontent.css</code> to give them a basic re-color.</p> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hqwoq9n.png" title="Re-colored dark scrollbar" />

<p>If you <b>want a different style on the scrollbars</b>, you can try using the <code>scrollbars.as.css</code> file inside the "Full dark theme" folder, which will make the scrollbars look more rounded and will have some sort of "puffy" effect when clicking them.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sOHN1ds.gif" title="Custom dark blue scrollbar" />

<p>If instead you just <b>don't want scrollbars to show at all but keep scrollability</b>, you can do this through <code>usercontent.css</code> setting the variable <code>--scrollbars-width</code> to none (should be the first rule on the <code>:root</code> section (almost at the start)), and deleting <code>scrollbars.as.css</code>.</p>
<p>If you aren't using the usercontent provided here for some reason, you can always just add this code to your self-created <code>usercontent.css</code>:</p><code>*|* {scrollbar-width: none !important}</code>
<br /><br />

<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<h3>The pre-loading screen of websites is still white, how can I change this?</h3>
<p>The fastest way to solve the "blinking" white screen is to change the default web background color on Firefox settings > General > "Colors..." button > Background, which will make the blinking dissapear and be changed to the color you set up. This, although, can cause some issues on some very few and specific pages like BBC, where they don't set a background color to override the one set here (the number of sites with this problem is very small, most sites override the background color set by this setting).</p>

<h3>The synced tabs sidebar isn't themed.</h3>
<p>Since it's anonymous content of the browser we can't theme it through userChrome or userContent, which is why you will have to apply the fix inside <code>Sync-tabs-sidebar.as.css</code>. It requires the use of external CSS files loading, which is enabled thorugh <code>userchrome.css</code> and <code>userchrome.xml</code>.</p>

<h3>Some context menu commands dissapear after installing userchrome.</h3>
<p>If you only want the dark theme, use the default <code>userchrome.css</code> file inside "Full dark theme", which won't make the context menu commands dissapear. In case you want to use the features part of the theme, just delete everything after the line that says <code>/* CONTEXT MENU COMMANDS */</code> (you can find it using the search option on notepad, or the code editor you are using).</p>
<p>In case you still want to delete some commands but not all, just comment out the ones that you want to appear, and leave as active the ones that you want to dissapear.</p>
<p>For example, this is active, so the command is hidden:</p>
<pre>/* Send image... */
#context-sendimage,</pre>
<p>...But this is commented out, so the command will show on the context menu:</p>
<pre>/* Send image... *//*
#context-sendimage,*/</pre>
<p>You will see that the ones that I have commented out by default only have the starting "/*" of the comment after the description of what they are, since the closing "*/" would come from the next description comment below them.</p>


<h3>The bookmarks toolbar text/tabs text color is black and I can't see the letters over the dark background.</h3>
<p>This is caused by your persona (lightweight theme), and while you could change these settings inside userchrome, I thought it was better to just change the settings on the persona directly (since not all personas will look the same). To do so you'd have to open <code>about:config</code>, and search for <b>lightweightThemes.usedThemes</b>. Once there, find the "textcolor" setting and type any color you'd want to use instead of black or the color being used by the theme (use #fff for white). The persona you are currently using should be in the first place in the list.</p>

<h3>The bookmarks multirow shows an empty scrollbar when enabled.</h3>
<p>If you are using an old version of the scrollbars, or you are just plain not using the scrollbars here, you will have to add some code to delete the empty scrollbars that show on the bookmark toolbars. You have to use this code on a "*.ac.css" file (so you would need to have firefox patched with the method explained on the <b>Tooltips, Scrollbars & Multirow tabs</b> folder), since otherwise it won't work:

<pre>
/* This deletes the scrollbar from bookmarks toolbar when using multirow bookmarks */
#PlacesToolbarItems scrollbar {display: none !important}
</pre>

<h3>I only want to use the multirow/(Any other) feature, but not the other ones!</h3>
<p>You only need to modify <b>userChrome.css</b>, deleting the lines that you don't want to apply (Every function has a comment above it saying what each ruleset does), or if you think you may want them later, just encase the feature parts that you don't want to apply between /* and */:</p>

<code>/* This is an example of a comment that wouldn't be read on a .css file */</code>

<h3>I'm opening web files locally (as in opening html pages that you have created or downloaded) and the background is not the color it should be.</h3>
<p>To change the directory browsing page and change how .css or some .txt files appear when opened with Firefox, I had to specify it to affect urls that start with "file:///", meaning that any file opened with Firefox will get overriden with those rules as well. To prevent this, go to userContent.css, and comment out the lines that affect this url (This rule should be exactly under the color variables at the start of the file).</p>

<h3>I placed userchrome.css inside my chrome folder and I still don't have multi-row tabs!</h3>
<p>While we only needed to use CSS to enable multi-row tabs, this breaks tabs draggability, making reordering tabs when it was enabled a bit erratic, so to fix this, I decided to put all multi-row tabs code inside the <b>MultiRowTabLiteforFx.uc.js</b> file. This means that now Multi-row tabs can be enabled following the method described inside the <code>Multirow and other functions/Multirow tabs</code> folder. If you were using CSS code on your <code>userchrome.css</code> to enable multirow tabs, delete (or comment it out) for the js file to take effect.</p>

<h3>Why use this method instead of using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a>?</h3>
<p>The main reason is that you can't style firefox about: pages nor the scrollbar with just stylus.</p>

<h3>The theme is making the text of some addon popups unreadable, how do I fix this?</h3>
<p>The theme is made so that it changes most background colors, including the one of the popups that don't have any background color specified by their original creator. Sadly it doesn't change the text of these by default, so you may have to do it manually, or report the addon you want themed here, or just use the fix inside userchrome.css (at around lines 326-329) to turn the addons back to their white background color.</p>
