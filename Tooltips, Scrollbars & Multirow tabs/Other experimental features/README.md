<h2>Other experimental features</h2>
<p>Here go any other experimental features that aren't the main focus of the theme and their description. You shouldn't really need to install these unless you want some very specific function.</p>

<p>You need to place <b>userchrome.xml</b> (If you already have one from this repository, you don't need to change it) on your chrome folder along with any of these files for them to work, along with it's binding rule on <b>userchrome.css</b>, which is already added in any of the userchrome versions of this repository. If you don't want to use any of the userchrome.css files from this repository, all you need to do is create your own with this code:</p>

<pre>
/* DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE */
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");

/* This enables the use of JS external files */
toolbarbutton#alltabs-button {
    -moz-binding: url("userChrome.xml#js")}
</pre>
<p>... or just the <b>toolbarbutton</b> rule if you had an existing userchrome that didn't come from this repository.</p>

<p>There are probably better alternatives out there, so you should only use these if you really couldn't find it anywhere else (since, as mentioned, these are experimental)</p>

<h3>Bookmarks-toggle.uc.js</h3>
<p>Toggles visibility of the bookmarks toolbar when pressing F2 (you can change which keys in the file). You'll need to add this rule to your userchrome:</p>
<pre>#PersonalToolbar {visibility: collapse !important}</pre>

<h3>Navigator-toolbox-autohide.uc.js</h3>
<p>Toggles visibility of the whole navigation toolbox as if you were on fullscreen, so that it's only visible when you have the mouse over it, or when hovering the mouse to the top of the screen when it's hidden.</p>
