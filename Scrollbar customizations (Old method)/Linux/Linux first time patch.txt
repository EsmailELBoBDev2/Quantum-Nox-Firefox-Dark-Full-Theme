You'd only have to apply the first-time patch once (either manually, or following the steps here).

For Linux, you would just need to run these on the commands window:

You can either use the "1st-patch.sh" file here, for which you'd first have to give it executable permisions with this:

chmod +x (route of 1st-patch.sh here)/1st-patch.sh

And then you can run it just typing:

sh 1st-patch.sh

Alternativelly, you can just type these commands directly on the terminal:

sudo mv ./scrollbars.css /usr/lib/firefox/browser
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib/firefox/browser/chrome.manifest'

Where "./scrollbars.css" assumes that you are in the folder where the scrollbars.css file is (if not, change the path as necessary).

For some distributions they make a difference between 64-bits firefox, so in case it gives you an error, you can try the 64-bits path:

For 64-bits Firefox:
sudo mv ./scrollbars.css /usr/lib64/firefox/browser
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib64/firefox//browser/chrome.manifest'

^ The default path of both of these may vary depending on your distribution or if you used a custom path.
