<h1>Alternative tooltip designs</h1>
<p>You can find alternative tooltip designs here. You should only use 1 at a time, and each time you change the style,
you'll have to clear the "startupcache" folder on the local folder inside <code>about:profiles</code>.</p>

<h3>tooltips-compact.uc.js</h3>
<p>This file will make the tooltips look the same as the default tooltips file of this theme, except with less padding, 
which makes them have more compact.</p>

<h3>tooltips-gray.uc.js</h3>
<p>This design will make the tooltips background color grayish.</p>

<h3>tooltips-dark.uc.js</h3>
<p>This design will make the tooltips background color almost black with a gray border.</p>

<h3>tooltips-translucid.uc.js</h3>
<p>This file will make the tooltips background be semi-transparent (at 80% opacity), so you can see through the tooltips a 
bit.</p>

<h3>Other variants</h3>
<p>As you can probably tell, any of the other ones not commented here is just a combination of the ones above.</p>
