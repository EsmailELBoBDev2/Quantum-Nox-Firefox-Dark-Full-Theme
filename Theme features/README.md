<h4>You can turn the features you want on or off changing the commented lines on the CSS file (To change them you just have to open the userchrome.css with notepad or any code editor, and encase between "/*" and "*/" (without the quotation marks) the lines you don't want to take effect). Of course, if you think that you are NEVER going to use certain feature, you can always delete the specific lines you don't want without any other side-effect.</h4>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>All you need to do is place the userChrome.css file inside <a href="https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/tree/master/Theme%20features#the-chrome-folder">the chrome folder</a> of your firefox profile.</p>

<h4>Step by step:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Type <code>about:support</code> in your URL bar, then go to that page.</li>
  <li>Click the "open folder" button inside the "profile folder" section.</li>
  <li>Create a folder named "chrome" in your profile folder if it doesn't exist yet.</li>
  <li>Place "userchrome.css" inside the "chrome" folder.</li>
  <li><b>Optional</b>: Edit userchrome.css to delete (or comment out) any function you aren't going to use or don't want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The chrome folder</h2>

<p>The fastest way to find it is to just type <code>about:support</code> on the URL bar of your firefox, and then click the <b>open folder</b> button inside the "profile folder" section. After this, your profile folder will be open.</p>

<p><i>You may or may not see the chrome folder. If you don't see it, just create it and place inside the usercontent.css and userchrome.css files.</i></p>

<p>If you want to know the exact location for profile folders (information taken from <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox">here</a>):</p>

<h4>On Windows 7 and above, profile folders are in this location, by default:</h4>

<pre>C:\Users\(Windows login/user name)\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profile folder)</pre>

<p><i>If you have never used userchrome.css or usercontent.css before, you will have to create a folder named "chrome" inside the profile folder, which is where you will have to place these files.</i></p>

<p>This is where you would have to place the files once you have created the chrome folder:</p>

<pre>C:\Users\(Windows login/user name)\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profile folder)\chrome\</pre>
  
<p>The AppData folder is a hidden folder; to show hidden folders, open a Windows Explorer window and choose "Tools → Folder Options → View (tab) → Show hidden files and folders".</p>

<p>You can also use this path to find the profile folder, even when it is hidden:</p>

<pre>%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profile folder)</pre>

<h4>On Linux, profile folders are located in this other location:</h4>

<pre>/home/(Your-username)/.mozilla/firefox/(profile folder)</pre>

<p><i>If you have never used userchrome.css or usercontent.css before, you will have to create a folder named "chrome" inside the profile folder, which is where you will have to place these files.</i></p>

<p>This is where you would have to place the files once you have created the chrome folder:</p>

<pre>/home/(Your-username)/.mozilla/firefox/(profile folder)/chrome/</pre>

<p>The ".mozilla" folder is a hidden folder. To show hidden files in Nautilus (Gnome desktop's default file browser), choose "View -> Show Hidden Files". On others such as Dolphin (Kubuntu's default file browser), you'd have to choose "Control -> Hidden files"</p>

<h4>On Mac, profile folders are in one of these locations:</h4>

<pre>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/(profile folder)
~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/(profile folder)</pre>

<p><i>If you have never used userchrome.css or usercontent.css before, you will have to create a folder named "chrome" inside the profile folder, which is where you will have to place these files.</i></p>

<p>This is where you would have to place the files once you have created the chrome folder:</p>

<pre>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/(profile folder)/chrome
~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/(profile folder)/chrome/</pre>

<p>The tilde character (~) refers to the current user's Home folder, so ~/Library is the /Macintosh HD/Users/(username)/Library folder. For OS X 10.7 Lion and above, the ~/Library folder is hidden by default.</p>

<p>You can make them visible by typing the following in a terminal window.</p>
<pre>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder</pre>
<p>This will also cause any file icons to take on a hazy, 50% alpha look. To restore the old settings (hide the files and make the icons look normal) issue the same commands again, but enter FALSE instead of TRUE.<p>
